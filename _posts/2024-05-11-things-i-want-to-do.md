Why I am writing this post? I don't know. Maybe I might forget about these points.
So here are a few things I want to do in my lifetime.

## Start a bus service

This is my childhood dreams that there will be a bus that will connect my village with nearby cities. [It is not inspired from Suryavansham]

## Explore India

I rarely think about exploring the whole world, but I want to explore India at slow speed (40km/h), maybe join a truck crew when I retire.

I will add more items here, when I will be ready to write them out.
