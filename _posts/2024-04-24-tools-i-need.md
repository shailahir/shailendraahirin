2. nodemon

## Code editor

1. VS Code
2. VS code theme - Monokai
3. Plugins - eslint, prettier
4. Prettier - format on save

## Browser extensions

1. React developer tools
2. Redux dev tools

## Other software

1. Postman 7
2. Git SCM with Tortoise Git
3. NodePad ++
4. Winmerge - Life saver tool when time comes

## Other preferences
